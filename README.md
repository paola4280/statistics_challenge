# statistics_challenge
Statistics challenge with Matplotlib applications.
Parts of the following snippets of code were taken from the internet or ChatGPT in order to debug the program:
- "nunique()"
- "[~merge_df['Mouse ID'].isin(duplicate_mice)]"
- ".agg(Mean='mean',Median='median',Variance='var',Std_Dev='std',SEM='sem')"
- "unique_mice = clean_df.drop_duplicates(subset='Mouse ID')"
