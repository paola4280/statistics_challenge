# statistics_challenge
Statistics challenge with Matplotlib applications.

The code for this challenge is found inside the Pymaceuticals folder and the file name is "Pymaceuticals_starter". 

The purpose of this activity is to combine the use of Pandas and Matplotlib with Statistics applications. Some covered activities include opening CSV files, merging files, cleaning data frames, filtering, and finding the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, standard error, IQR, correlation coefficient, and regression line. Additionally, the challenge included bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, line plots, and regression lines.

Parts of the following snippets of code were taken from the internet or ChatGPT in order to debug the program:
- "nunique()"
- "[~merge_df['Mouse ID'].isin(duplicate_mice)]"
- ".agg(Mean='mean',Median='median',Variance='var',Std_Dev='std',SEM='sem')"
- "unique_mice = clean_df.drop_duplicates(subset='Mouse ID')"
