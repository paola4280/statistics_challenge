# statistics_challenge
Statistics challenge with Matplotlib applications.

The file inside the Pymaceuticals is now up to date and contains all the files needed for the challenge! 

The  code for this challenge was found on the main page of the repository and the file name is "Pymaceuticals_starter". I was having issues with my git so I manually uploaded my files for your access. 

The purpose of this activity is to combine the use of Pandas and Matplotlib with Statistics applications. Some covered activities include opening CSV files, merging files, cleaning data frames, filtering, and finding the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, standard error, IQR, correlation coefficient, and regression line. Additionally, the challenge included bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, line plots, and regression lines.

Parts of the following snippets of code were taken from the internet or ChatGPT in order to debug the program:
- "nunique()"
- "[~merge_df['Mouse ID'].isin(duplicate_mice)]"
- ".agg(Mean='mean',Median='median',Variance='var',Std_Dev='std',SEM='sem')"
- "unique_mice = clean_df.drop_duplicates(subset='Mouse ID')"
